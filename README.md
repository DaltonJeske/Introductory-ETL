Introductory ETL was the course that taught me how to Extract, Transfer, and Load data to different destinations. The core competencies of this course inlcude: Perform data integration, Develop an ETL data pipeline, Extract data from structured and unstructured data sources, Interpret data for usability, Transfrom dat to meet requirements, and Load data into the target destination. The biggest take away from this course was the importance of cleaning your data after extraction. Data comes in many types and formats and cleaning it to fit your needs is vital to any successful use. The files utilized Alteryx to perform various ETL manipulations on the data.
